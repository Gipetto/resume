# Resume Project

For some inexplicable reason Iâ€™m drawn to the resume as a demo project to learn and practice new front end technologies.

So, here lies a Svelte app. Overblown in every way.

---

## Development

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can now load `localhost:5000` to load the app with live-reload.

## Deploy

Open an PR. Once approved and merged, the main branch will automatically build and deploy to Github Pages.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement i18Next for translations
