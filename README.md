# Resume Project

For some inexplicable reason I'm drawn to the resume as a demo project to learn and practice new front end technologies.

So, here lies a Svelte app. Overblown in every way.

---

## Development

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

You can now load `localhost:5000` to load the app with live-reload.

## Preview

```
yarn build
yarn serve
```

You can now load `localhost:5000` to preview the production build.

## Deploy

Open an PR. Once approved, the main branch will automatically build and deploy to Github Pages.

## TODO

- [] Implement i18Next for translations
